Migrating between mvc frameworks
reason  - just learned angular and already I'm curious about reach + backbone, and addyosmani's web components thing
 - woudl like to be able to adopt the latest thing easily

principles never use $rootScope etc in any service other than 1 connector to angular

assumed features

render method - in angular it's null, but shoudl be called after anything that woudl typically need a redraw
events
ability for the viewmodel/$scoep to have methods and properties

initialise all a module's services etc
